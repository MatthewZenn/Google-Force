# **Google-Force**
A magic app disguised as the Google homepage

<br>

*Effect*

You have a spectator think of a favorite food. They are then invited to take out their phone and open a new tab in a browser of their choice.
You ask to take the the phone from them and draw attention to the "Feeling Lucky" button on the homepage.
The spectator is asked to reveal the food they are thinking of, at which point, the button is tapped to reveal that Goolge knew all along: *Pizza*.

<br>

*Method*

You must first force the word *pizza* upon the spectator by any method of your choosing. Once the spectator has handed you their phone, you explain that you're going to just go to the google.com hompage. In reality, you will instead type in the link to this site. A Bit.ly link has also been provided, as to not arouse suspicion. After this, the trick is now set for you to perform.
