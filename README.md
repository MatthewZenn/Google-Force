# **Google-Force**
A magic app disguised as the Google homepage

<br>

***Effect***

You have a spectator think of or choose a card. They are then invited to take out their phone and open a new tab in a browser of their choice.
You ask to take the the phone from them and draw attention to the *Feeling Lucky* button on the Google homepage.
The spectator is asked to reveal the card they are thinking of, at which point, the button is tapped to reveal that Goolge knew all along: *Seven of Spades*.

<br>

***Method***

You must first force the *Seven of Spades* upon the spectator by any method of your choosing. Once the spectator has handed you their phone, you explain that you're going to just go to the google.com hompage. In reality, you will instead type in the link to this site. A Bit.ly link has also been provided, as to not arouse suspicion. After this, the trick is now set for you to perform.

<br>

Because the site actually redirects to google.com, the spectator is free to press the button themselves. Once the card is revealed, the tricks is done and there is no evidence that it was a trick site (unless they hit the back arrow.) But, the spectator will most likely be more concerend with making sure its actually the real Google page.

***Bonus***

By default the site is set to reveal the *Seven of Spades* force. Howver, If you choose to do so, the app can be setup to instead predict wrong on the first attempt. After going to the site, simply tap the *Sign In* button to prep the miss. Not only can this serve as a fun gag, It also serves to show the spectator that the browser is being refreshed before the second attempt.
